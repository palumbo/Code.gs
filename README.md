This is the Google App Script I use to automate Google Workspace products. 

Never used Google's App Script before? Below you'll find basic instructions on how to use these scripts in Sheets, Docs, and GMail. 

## CPC Analysis
Click on *Extentions* > *Apps Script*. Delete the *myFunction()* that is already in the editor and copy/paste my code in. 

Now click on *Save* (or Command + S) and then *Run* (or Commandn + R). 

The first time you run the script it will ask you to give it permissions, click *Allow*. 

Now sit back and wait because while App Script is useful, it is painfully slow. 

You'll know when the code has finished running because a new tab called CPC Analysis will pop up.
